                        Traveling is something that I have always enjoyed since I was a little kid. That is all I want to do someday, 
                        try and make it everywhere I possibly can. The world is a beautiful place and I want to see it all!

                        When I have time, which is not very often, I really enjoy reading and writing. I also enjoy watching movies and tv shows. 
                        It does not matter what genre it is, I enjoy almost anything when it comes to watching shows or reading. When I start reading a book, 
                        or a comic it is hard for me to put them down. I also like to write fiction, though I have not for a while. Hoping to pick that back up soon.

                        Getting into property management was not planned. I was going to school the first time around, I need something
                        that was going to work with my schedule as I was a full time student trying to get two degrees. I found a part-time
                        position that was close to my home. I got the job and eventually started working full-time. I managed many properties
                        with a lot of different rules. My boss was amazing though so that helped things, but not something I would do again.

                        After I graduated from college I was able to land a really amazing job as a Network Technician. I did not start looking for a job 
                        right away after gradation but when I did thankfully it did not take long for me to find one. With my network and security school experience
                        it made things a little easier on the job, though it was nothing like college. I did many things, and traveled to the different locations
                        we had. We were county employees so I supported all kinds of different people and equipment. I learned so much from that job, including what 
                        I really wanted to do in the computer field. That is why I went back to school for the degree I am seeking now, Software Development.

                        A job that I will forever love and miss was managing a Vet Clinic. It was a small family owned vet clinic and it was just so amazing. I have
                        always loved animals and my family and I are pretty much crazy animal people, not just cats. I got this job through a connection that I had
                        and it was the best thing I have ever done. The most rewarding too. The owner ended up retiring and selling the place that is why I had to move 
                        on with that chapter of my life. Since it was a small vet clinic, I got to do a little bit of everything there. I loved it all. Someday I want
                        to own my own boarding business. One day hopefully!
